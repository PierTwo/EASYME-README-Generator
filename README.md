# EASYME README Generator

## Description

This project uses Node.js and Inquirer to run a CLI app that generates a basic markdown file based on user input.

- This project was built in order to help a user quickly generate a basic README for their project.
- This projects solves needing to recreate the same basic layout with info for each project a user develops.
- I learned how I can seperate my concerns better in a Node.js project by using seperate files for different concerns and exporting them as modules to be used elsewhere.

## Installation

If you do not have Node.js installed, first go to the [Node.js website](https://nodejs.org/en/) and follow the instructions to install Node.js. Once you have Node.js Installed or if you already had it on your machine use git to clone the project repository from GitHub. After cloning, run npm i or npm install from the CLI in the directory of the project to install all neccessary dependencies for this project.

## Usage

From the repository directory run npm start or node index.js in the CLI, then input y to continue when prompted, otherwise n to exit the app. If you chose to continue input all the relevant info for each
question before entering to continue to the next question. You can choose to not include a section in your markdown file by not inputting anything on a question.
